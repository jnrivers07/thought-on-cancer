How I feel about the disease
This is a tribute to my grandmother, who was diagnosed with uterine cancer on Oct 2022. This is her second battle with cancer, as she survived breast cancer almost 20 years ago.
The colors in the vinyl represent breast cancer (pink) and uterine cancer (peach). She likes jazz music, so I created the spinning vinyl.
This is also my first non-freeCodeCamp project. Thanks for checking it out :)
